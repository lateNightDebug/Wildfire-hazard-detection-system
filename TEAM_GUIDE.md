# PART 1 — Everyone

## 1. What this project is (in 60 seconds)

**The problem:** Alberta's forests are full of **standing dead trees** — dry fuel
that turns a spark into a crown fire. Today, crews find them by walking the
forest with binoculars: slow, subjective, and hard to map.

**Our solution:** a **fully-offline desktop application**. A drone flies the
forest; our app reads the photos, finds hazards with AI, lets a person confirm
each one, and produces a GPS-accurate hazard map and a PDF field report.

**Who uses it:** forestry / fire crews working in the field, **with no internet**.
That constraint drives the entire design.

**One sentence to memorize:**
> "It turns a drone flight into a reviewed, GPS-accurate hazardous-tree map and
> field report — completely offline."

## 2. The one idea you must understand

**AI detections are PROPOSALS, not answers. A human confirms them.**

Why? Because of physics, not laziness: with a normal RGB camera you **cannot**
reliably tell dead wood from bare brown ground — the wavelength that separates
them (SWIR) isn't captured by the camera. We tested this and confirmed it in
the literature.

So the design is deliberately:

```
AI finds candidates  →  a person confirms/corrects  →  confirmed boxes become
                                                        BOTH the report data
                                                        AND the training set
```

Every review makes the next model better. That loop is the heart of the product.
If someone asks "how accurate is your AI?", the honest answer is: *"The AI
proposes; the operator decides. The confirmed results feed training, so accuracy
improves with every mission."*

## 3. The three AI pieces

| # | What | Where it runs |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | **Detection** — YOLO11 (flame/smoke) + DeepForest (dead-tree candidates), with SAHI tiling so tiny trees in 21-megapixel photos are found | Field laptop GPU, ~13 s/photo, offline |
| 2 | **Report analysis** — a local LLM (LM Studio) writes a 5-section professional analysis grounded in the real numbers and GPS | Field laptop, offline |
| 3 | **Training loop** — confirmed boxes → Azure Custom Vision (cloud training) → ONNX model → runs offline | Cloud for training only |

## 4. Running it

Every script in the project root says which OS it is for, in the filename.
Never run the other platform's one — it installs the wrong PyTorch build.

| | Windows | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| **Install** (first time only, ~4 GB) | `install-windows.bat` | `install-macos.command` |
| **Console** (browser mode) | `run-console-windows.bat` | `run-console-macos.command` |
| **Legacy review app** | `run-app-windows.bat` | `run-app-macos.command` |

All six are double-clickable — `.command` is the macOS counterpart of `.bat`,
so Finder opens Terminal and runs it with nothing to type.

```bash
# Every day, after the one-time install:
Windows: double-click "Wildfire Hazard Detection" on the Desktop
macOS:   double-click "Wildfire Hazard Detection" on the Desktop
         (or Cmd-Space and type the name - macOS 26 removed Launchpad)
```

If the shortcut / app is missing, start it directly — or re-run
`python -m scripts.install_desktop_app` to recreate it:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m src.wildfire.console --desktop   # Windows
.venv/bin/python -m src.wildfire.console --desktop           # macOS
```

Everything below is written with the Windows path; on macOS swap
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe` for `.venv/bin/python`, and the `-windows.bat`
scripts for their `-macos.command` twins in the table above.

**Optional:** start LM Studio with a model loaded *before* generating a report,
or the report simply omits the AI analysis section (everything else still works).

## 5. The normal workflow (what a demo looks like)

1. **Scans page → Mission Folder** — paste the flight folder path (e.g. `F:\DCIM`),
   click *Load folder*.
   The app reads **only images**, sorts them by capture time, and groups them into
   **flights** (a >45 min gap or a new day starts a new flight; long shoots split
   into ~100-image parts). Telemetry files are ignored. DJI RTK `.MRK` files give
   centimetre-grade GPS.
2. **Detect** — click *Detect all* on a flight card (or *Select images* to pick a
   subset). Detection runs in a **separate background process** — you can keep
   using the app while it works.
3. **Review** — open the finished run → *✎ Review boxes*: zoom in, delete wrong
   boxes, draw missed ones, set labels → *Save review*. Use *Mark reviewed* per
   image to track progress (the green check on thumbnails).
4. **Report** — *Generate Report* → a timestamped PDF that reads conclusions-first:
   batch summary, a full-page satellite hazard map, the AI analysis, then the
   imagery (full pages for the worst few, a gallery contact sheet for the rest,
   and an index row for every image).
5. **Overview** — Dashboard (stats + map), Review (backlog by day), Map (all sites),
   Reports (all PDFs). **Double-click any map pin** to open the map fullscreen on
   that site; *Esc* exits.

## 6. Where everything lives

```
outputs/<run>_<timestamp>/     one folder per detection run
   originals/  annotated/  gridmaps/    the three image renditions
   batch.json          detections + GPS + stats (machine-readable)
   labels.json         confirmed boxes = the training set
   reviewed_images.json  which images the operator ticked off
   report_<time>.pdf   reports (a new file each time, never overwritten)
models/     detector weights (fire/smoke .pt, your trained dead_tree.onnx)
map/        offline satellite tiles + road/water overlays
branding/   logo + brand.json (see LOGO_GUIDE.txt inside)
config/settings.json    all settings (editable in the Settings page)
```

**Nothing is uploaded anywhere.** Everything stays on the machine.

## 7. Routine maintenance (no coding needed)

| Task | How |
|------|-----|
| **Change the logo / app name** | Drop `logo.png` into `branding/`, edit `branding/brand.json`, restart the app. Applies to the UI *and* the PDF. |
| **Tune detection** (confidence, tile size) | Settings page → Detection. Takes effect on the next run. |
| **Change severity thresholds** | Settings page → Display severity (dead trees per image). |
| **Set who produced a run** | Settings page → Operator name. Shows on reports. Optional; it is *not* a login. |
| **Add your trained model** | Put `dead_tree.onnx` + `dead_tree.labels.txt` into `models/`. The app picks it up automatically. If boxes look wrong, flip *Normalize* / *Channel order* in Settings. |
| **Download map for a new area** | Map page → *⬇ Map data* → pick "Around my scanned area" (needs internet once). |
| **Free up disk space** | Delete whole `outputs/<run>/` folders you no longer need. Each run is self-contained. Keep `labels.json` if you want to preserve training data. |
| **Check the AI report writer** | Settings → *Test connection* (LM Studio). |
| **Share results between machines** | Settings → Cloud sync. Paste the SAS URL the admin generated, *Test connection*, switch on. There is **no login** — the token is the access. See below. |

### What actually gets shared

By default the cloud carries **findings, not photos**: one small JSON per run with the
detections, GPS, statistics and confirmed labels. On the real runs in this repo that is
2,056 MB on disk versus **48 KB** uploaded. The imagery — and the PDF, which alone was
55.8 MB for one run — stays on the machine that flew the mission.

So a colleague who imports your run sees the map, the counts, the dashboard totals and
your confirmed boxes, but not the photos. The Scan Detail page says so plainly and hides
box review, because there is no image to draw on. That is deliberate: the useful part
travels, the bulk and the privacy-sensitive part does not.

Settings → *What gets uploaded* can be switched to **Everything** if you want a full
off-site backup of a run (imagery and PDF included, ~1.7 GB for 58 images).

**Who owns a run:** the machine that produced it. Others import it read-only. There is no
merge logic and none is needed — one operator flies one mission.

### Setting up cloud sync (optional, off by default)

There is no account system and none is needed: Azure Storage is the identity layer, and
the credential you paste decides what the app can reach. So issue a narrow one.

**Admin, once.** Create a Storage Account and a **private** container named
`wildfire-runs`. Open the container → *Shared access tokens* → tick **Read, Write, List**
(leave **Delete** unticked) → set an expiry → copy the **Blob SAS URL**. Send that to the
team.

**Each machine, once.** Settings → Cloud sync → paste the URL → *Test connection* → turn
it on. That is the whole setup — no username, no password.

Why a SAS URL and not the connection string the portal shows first: that string contains
`AccountKey=`, the account master key. It can read, write and **delete** every container
in the account and never expires, so one lost laptop compromises everything. A SAS token
reaches a single container, can be different per device, expires by itself, and can be
revoked on its own. *Test connection* tells you which kind you pasted.

Two practical notes: a scoped token **cannot create its container**, so make it in the
portal first; and on a shared machine set `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` in the
environment instead, which takes precedence and keeps the secret out of
`config/settings.json`.

## 8. When something goes wrong

| Symptom | Cause / Fix |
|---------|-------------|
| **Blank window on launch** | Windows 10 needs the WebView2 runtime — install it, relaunch. macOS uses the built-in WebKit and needs nothing. |
| **"Port 7861 is in use"** | The app is already running — check the taskbar / Task Manager, or the Dock / Activity Monitor on macOS. |
| **macOS: the app icon bounces and quits** | The venv moved or was rebuilt, so the launcher points at a python that no longer exists. Re-run `./install.sh`. |
| **Page looks unstyled, "Failed to fetch"** | The app was updated while running. **Close the window and reopen.** (Pages reload from disk, but the Python service only loads at startup.) |
| **Detection stuck on "loading detection models…"** | First run downloads model weights — needs internet once. Check `outputs/<run>/_worker.log`. |
| **Report has no AI section** | LM Studio isn't running. Optional — start it and regenerate. |
| **Map is a stylized drawing, not satellite** | No tiles cached for that area — Map page → *⬇ Map data*. |
| **No GPS on the map** | Photos have no EXIF GPS and no `.MRK` file beside them. |
| **Every image shows "no detections" with a new ONNX model** | Wrong preprocessing — flip `onnx_normalize` (`0-255` ↔ `0-1`) or `onnx_channel_order` (RGB ↔ BGR) in Settings. |

**Golden rule: after any code update, restart the app.**

## 9. How to explain this project (every member should be able to)

Be ready to answer these in your own words:

- **What problem does it solve?** → Section 1.
- **What's the AI doing?** → Section 3 (three pieces: detect, analyse, learn).
- **Why is a human in the loop?** → Section 2 (RGB/SWIR physics — this is a
  *design decision*, not a weakness).
- **Where's the cloud?** → Training runs on Azure Custom Vision; map imagery comes
  from Esri and is cached. The app itself is deployed at the **edge** (the field
  laptop) because the client works without connectivity.
- **Is it microservices?** → Honestly, no — it's a **modular monolith**. Detection
  runs in a separate low-priority process (because heavy inference used to freeze
  the UI), the LLM is a separate service we call over HTTP, and Custom Vision is
  an external cloud service. For a single-operator offline tool, network
  microservices would add latency and failure modes with no benefit.
- **What are the limits?** → Detections are proposals; overlapping photos can
  count the same tree more than once (we merge sites within 40 m on the map);
  severity badges are a display aid, not a formal risk score.

Numbers worth remembering: **72 automated tests**, **~13 s per 21 MP photo on GPU**,
a real **1,558-image** DJI L2 mission processed, **centimetre-grade RTK GPS**.

```
photo on SD card
  → ingest.scan_source()        reads capture time, ignores non-images
  → jobs.start_detection()      writes a job spec, spawns worker.py
  → worker → pipeline.run_batch()
        → _detection_source()   pre-compress if over preprocess_max_mb
        → detectors             SAHI tiles → YOLO / DeepForest / ONNX → NMS
        → annotate              boxes + density grid images
        → gps                   .MRK (preferred) or EXIF
  → outputs/<run>/batch.json + originals/ annotated/ gridmaps/
  → console data.scan_detail()  → Scan Detail page
  → user reviews → POST /api/scans/{id}/labels → labels.json (+ confirmed images)
  → POST /api/scans/{id}/report → report.build_report() → PDF
  → scripts/export_labels.py → Custom Vision dataset → cloud training → ONNX
```

## 12. Making common changes

| I want to… | Do this |
|------------|---------|
| Change UI text on a page | Edit that page's HTML in `console/pages/` |
| Change colors globally | `console/static/console.css`, the `:root` variables |
| Add a new setting | Add the field to `Settings` in `config.py`, add it to both `config/settings*.json`, add it to `_EDITABLE_SETTINGS` in `server.py` and to the Settings page HTML + its `FIELDS` array |
| Add a new API endpoint | `console/server.py`, inside `create_app()` |
| Add a new detector type | Write a class with `.predict(image) -> list[Detection]`, register it in `detectors.py`, add a `model_sources` entry |
| Change the PDF | `report.py` — sections in order: `_cover`, `_summary_page` (stats + hazard map + AI), `_image_page` (full page, worst few), `_gallery_pages` (contact sheet 8-up), `_image_index` (every image) |
| Make reports shorter / longer | Settings page → *Images with imagery* and *Full-page images* |
| Change the AI report wording | `llm.py` → `SYSTEM_PROMPT` |

## 13. Testing and committing

```bash
# Once per machine - the installers skip these, they are not needed to RUN the app
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q        # 120 tests, must stay green
```

`tests/test_frontend_contract.py` is the one to know about. The console has no
build step, so nothing normally notices when a page and `console.js` stop
agreeing — renaming a shared helper used to pass every test and break the page in
front of the operator. These tests read each page's inline JS and check that every
function it calls actually exists. **If they fail after you rename something in
`console.js`, the fix is to update the pages that call it, not to loosen the test.**

**Commit rules for this repo:**
- **No AI signatures / "Co-Authored-By" lines** in commit messages (we work with
  multiple AI tools; per-model footers make the history confusing).
- Write what changed and *why*, not just what.
- Keep tests green before pushing.

## 13b. Working in parallel (several people, several branches)

Everyone works on their own branch and nobody merges into `main` without saying so
first — a surprise merge interrupts whoever is mid-change.

**Formatting is settled — there are config files now.** A branch once arrived with
438 changed lines in `dashboard.html` of which exactly **one** was a real edit; the
other 437 were an editor's auto-format (single-line SVGs split across lines, spaces
added inside CSS). Invisible in the browser, enormous in a diff, and it buries the
change a reviewer needs to see. The repo now carries:

- **`.editorconfig`** — charset, line endings, indent width per file type. VS Code,
  Visual Studio, PyCharm and Vim honour it (some need the EditorConfig plugin).
- **`.prettierrc.json`** — HTML/CSS/JS settings, `printWidth: 120`. That number was
  measured, not picked: 96% of the existing lines are already under it, so adopting
  the config does not itself trigger the reformat storm it prevents. Prettier's
  default of 80 would have rewrapped 19% of the codebase on first save.

Neither is enforced at commit time. The point is that everyone's editor already
agrees. **If you do reformat a file, put it in its own commit** with nothing else in
it — a reviewer can then skip it in one glance.

**Reading a diff that looks huge?** Check whether it is real before panicking:

```bash
git diff -w --ignore-blank-lines origin/main...their-branch -- path/to/file
```

If that comes back nearly empty, the change is cosmetic.

**Reviewing someone else's branch locally.** Stop the server, `git switch`, restart it
— and then **hard-refresh the browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R). `/static` is served with
strong caching, so otherwise you get a mix: their HTML with your cached `console.js`,
which shows a UI that exists on no branch at all. This has already caused one round of
confusion.

**Delete branches once they are merged.** A merged branch that stays on the remote
looks like unfinished work to everyone else.

**Settled:** the second UI is gone. `UI/` (a Tkinter prototype with login screens and
Admin/Pilot roles) and `Userbase samples/` (its sample credential CSV) were deleted on
2026-07-25. Nothing referenced them, and they contradicted the no-account-system rule
the product is described by. **There is one UI: `src/wildfire/console/`.**

**Settled: we are not containerising.** The product is a desktop app — a
native pywebview window plus local GPU inference — and it is deployed to a field
laptop that has no connectivity. A Linux container has neither a display nor GPU
passthrough by default, so containerising changes what the product *is* rather than
how it ships. The attempt on `styling_and_UX` demonstrates the mismatch concretely:
its `Dockerfile` uses a Linux base image with `install.bat` as the entry point, so
there is no `CMD.exe` to run it. **If asked in a review, the answer is that we
evaluated it and it does not fit a desktop application** — that is an engineering
decision with a reason, which is worth more than a container that does not start.

**Settled: cloud sync ships, and it carries findings only.** Off by default, lazily
imported (an install without `azure-storage-blob` runs normally), and it uploads a
small results JSON rather than imagery — 2,056 MB of runs becomes 48 KB. See
"What actually gets shared" above. This is a course requirement; the client is not
expected to enable it.

## 14. Gotchas (things that already bit us)

1. **Restart after code changes.** HTML/JS reload per request; Python doesn't.
   Mixing new pages with an old server causes confusing errors.
2. **Never do heavy work inside a request.** Detection runs in a subprocess and
   report generation in a background thread *because* both used to freeze the
   window. Follow that pattern for anything slow.
3. **PDF fonts are Latin-1 only.** Smart quotes/dashes/Chinese become black boxes.
   `report.py` has `_pdf_safe()` — use ASCII in new report strings.
4. **DeepForest takes ~10 s to import.** Use `find_spec` to check availability,
   don't import it just to test presence.
5. **`config/settings.json` is gitignored.** If you change a default, also update
   `config/settings.example.json`.
6. **Big flights are the real test.** 100+ images exposes performance bugs that
   6 images never will (thumbnail loading, report rendering, layout overflow).
7. **Don't add fake features.** We removed a fake "Operator/Admin" chip and an
   "Alerts" placeholder — an honest UI is easier to defend than a decorative one.
