"""Install the console as a desktop app: app icon + a launcher you double-click.

Windows: writes assets/wildfire.ico and Desktop / Start Menu shortcuts that run
`pythonw.exe -m src.wildfire.console --desktop` - a native window, no terminal.

macOS: writes assets/wildfire.icns and `~/Applications/Wildfire Hazard
Detection.app`, a minimal bundle whose launcher runs the same command with
`.venv/bin/python`. An .app never shows a terminal, so there is no pythonw
equivalent to hunt for, and the bundle is what puts the app in Launchpad,
Spotlight and the Dock.

Run again any time to refresh; delete the shortcut / bundle to "uninstall".
